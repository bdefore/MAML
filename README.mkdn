## Description

MAML is MXML in the spirit of YAML.

## Prerequisites

* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
    
## Example Usage
    
**WARNING** Use at your own discretion, this is experimental hobby code and should not be relied on for building rockets to space. Check in your code before you mess with this.

	From MXML, generate a creature that nurses its young from teats:
	ruby maml.rb test.mxml test.maml

	From MAML, generate a dinosaur named Bethany:
	ruby maml.rb test.maml Bethany.mxml
	
	Rebuild my dinosaur every time I save my MAML:
	ruby rstakeout.rb "ruby maml.rb test.maml Bethany.mxml" test.maml

## Known Issues

* All comments are stripped
* A single <fx:Script> tag is preserved during the conversion.
* If you toss in a non-existent dinosaur, you set the MAML on fire

## Future Ideas

* Make tests for it
* Preserve comments in a pleasant format
* Formatting for ActionScript within Script tags
* Remove need for namespacing, generate a massively polluted MXML opening tag that contains all possible namespace enumerations, including any directory in the source path, and prepend these generated namespaces to the classes they would affect. This would probably not be appreciated by parallel developers.
* Something similar for all those silly improt statements

Please fork, have your way with it, and tell me how it goes!
